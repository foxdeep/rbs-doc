After successfully completing your booking, you'll be directed to the 'Booked Page,' where you'll receive confirmation of your reservation. Here, you have a few options:

- **✅ Success** or **❌ Failure** Confirmation:
  The 'Booked Page' will clearly indicate whether your booking was successful or if there was a failure. Success means your reservation has been confirmed and is ready for activate.
