## Items

In the RBS Admin Portal's Resource Management section, administrators have the capability to manage not only the resources themselves but also the individual items associated with those resources. This feature provides a comprehensive view and control over the items connected to a resource, enhancing the organization's ability to monitor and maintain its assets.

Administrators can easily access a resource's associated items by clicking on the respective row in the table within the Resource Management interface. This action provides direct access to the items linked to the selected resource, allowing for in-depth management and oversight.

### CRUD

Within the 'Items' section, administrators can perform a range of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to maintain the resource's individual components. These operations include:

- ‚ûï Create: Administrators can add new items to the resource, specifying details such as item name, stock, price, and any other relevant information.

- üëÄ Read: The 'Read' functionality enables administrators to view detailed information about each item, including its attributes, status, and associated data.

- üñäÔ∏è Update: Administrators can modify item details as needed, ensuring that the information remains accurate and up to date. This includes the ability to adjust quantities, update conditions, or make other relevant changes.

- ‚ùå Delete: If an item is no longer in use or needs to be removed from the resource, administrators can easily delete it from the resource's item list, ensuring a well-organized and up-to-date inventory.

The ability to manage resource items not only enhances asset tracking and maintenance but also contributes to efficient resource allocation. It allows administrators to ensure that the resource's components are in optimal condition and readily available for users. The 'Items' section simplifies the process of managing and maintaining the individual elements that make up the resource, providing a comprehensive solution for resource management within your organization.
