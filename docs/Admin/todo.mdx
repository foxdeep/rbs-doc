Welcome to the To-Do section of the RBS Admin Portal, your control center for managing jobs related to booking delivery. In this section, you will find a list of 'jobs,' each representing a collection of booking tickets that need your attention. These jobs encompass the coordination and settlement of multiple bookings to ensure efficient resource utilization.

As an administrator, you have the flexibility to review and take action on these jobs. When you open a job, you can access detailed information about the included bookings, such as the requested resources, scheduled times, and settlement requirements. This comprehensive view allows you to make informed decisions and ensures that your organization's resource allocation runs smoothly.

What sets the To-Do section apart is the ability to add and manage notes within each job. Administrators can attach notes to jobs, providing a way to record essential information, instructions, or comments related to the job at hand. These notes serve as a handy reference for both yourself and your team, improving communication and keeping everyone on the same page.

Additionally, the To-Do section maintains a comprehensive action history for each job. This history log tracks all actions taken, such as **executing**, **dropping**, or **finishing** bookings within the job. It provides a clear and organized record of the job's progress and activities, ensuring transparency and accountability in resource management.
